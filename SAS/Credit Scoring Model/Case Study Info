A credit card company wants to build a credit scoring model, to predict the bad customers.

The company has data on customers details including  the demographic and credit bureau variables.

The dataset contains 1,50,000 observations across 17 variables.

The dependent variable is NPA_Status (0/1).

I have developed a logistic regression model to predict the probability of defaulting for each customer.
